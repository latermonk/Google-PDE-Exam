# Migrating On-Premises to  Hadoop

This guide provides an overview of how to move your on-premises Apache Hadoop system to Google Cloud. It describes a migration process that not only moves your Hadoop work to Google Cloud, but also enables you to adapt your work to take advantage of the benefits of a Hadoop system optimized for cloud computing. It also introduces some fundamental concepts you need to understand to translate your Hadoop configuration to Google Cloud.

This is the first of several guides describing how to move from on-premises Hadoop:


*   [Migrating On-Premises Hadoop Infrastructure to Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/migration/hadoop/hadoop-gcp-migration-overview) provides an overview of the migration process, with particular emphasis on moving from large, persistent clusters to an ephemeral model.
*   [Migrating HDFS Data from On-Premises to Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/migration/hadoop/hadoop-gcp-migration-data) provides additional context for incrementally moving your data to Google Cloud.
*   [Migrating data from HBase to Cloud Bigtable](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/migration/hadoop/hadoop-gcp-migration-data-hbase-to-bigtable)
*   [Migrating Hadoop Jobs from On-Premises to Dataproc](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/migration/hadoop/hadoop-gcp-migration-jobs) describes the process of running your jobs on Dataproc and other Google Cloud products.
